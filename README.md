# Crystals Collector

## Overview

This game was created to practice jQuery interaction with HTML. The user is shown a random target number at the start of the game in the score box. There are four crystals that load onto the page. Each crystal has a randomly generated number which is tied to it as a property, and clicking on it adds that specific amount of points to the user's total score. The game is won by matching the total score to the random target number. The game is lost if the total score goes above the random number.
